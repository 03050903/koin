== Using Scopes

Koin brings a simple API to let you define instances that are tied to a limit lifetime.

=== What is a scope?

Scope is a fixed duration of time or method calls in which an object exists.
Another way to look at this is to think of scope as the amount of time an objectâ€™s state persists.
When the scope context ends, any objects bound under that scope cannot be injected again (they are dropped from the container).

=== Scope definition

By default in Koin, we have 3 kind of scopes:

- `single` definition, create an object that persistent with the entire container lifetime (can't be dropped).
- `factory` definition, create a new object each time. No persistence in the container (can't be shared).
- `scope` definition, create an object that persistent tied to the associated scope lifetime.

To declare a scope definition, use the `scope` function:

[source,kotlin]
----
module {
    scope { Presenter() }
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
A scope definition can't be resolved without any scope: `get<Presenter>()` will result in an error. You have to create or retrieve a previously created scope,
and give it when resolving instance: `get<Presenter>(scope = /* your scope */)``
====

=== Create & retrieve a scope

From a `KoinComponent` class, just use the `getKoin()` function to have access to following functions

- `createScope(id : String)` - create a scope with given id in the Koin scope registry
- `getScope(id : String)` - retrieve a previously created scope with given id, from the Koin scope registry
- `getOrCreateScope(id : String)` - create or retrieve if already created, the scope with given id in the Koin scope registry

=== Using a scope

Once you have your `Scope` instance, let use it to resolve a component:

.from a KoinComponent class
[source,kotlin]
----
// create a scope
val session = getKoin().createScope("session")

// or get scope if already created before
val session = getKoin().getScope("session")

// will return the same instance of Presenter until 'session' is closed
val presenter = get<Presenter>(scope = session)
----

Just specify which scope to use when resolving it: `by inject(scope = /* your scope */)` or `get(scope = /* your scope */)`

=== Inject it with DSL

If one of your definition need to inject a scope instance, just resolve it by precising the needed scope:

[source,kotlin]
----
class Presenter(val userSession : UserSession)
----

Just inject it into constructor, with teh right scope:

[source,kotlin]
----
module {
    // Shared user session data
    scope { UserSession() }
    // Inject UserSession instance from "session" Scope
    factory { Presenter(get(scope = getScope("session")))}
}
----

=== Closing a scope

Once your scope is finished, just closed it with the `Scope.close()` function:

[source,kotlin]
----
// from a KoinComponent
val session = getKoin().createScope("session")
// will return the same instance of Presenter until 'session' is closed
val presenter = get<Presenter>(scope = session)

// close it
session.close()
// instance of presenter has been dropped
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Beware that you can't inject instances anymore from a closed scope.
====

=== Scope closing callback

It's also possible to listen scope closing. Just use the `registerScopeCallback()` function to register a `ScopeCallback` instance.

This will notify your `ScopeCallback` on the `onClose(id: String)` function, when a scope has been closed.

[source,kotlin]
----
registerScopeCallback(object : ScopeCallback{
        override fun onClose(id: String) {
            // scope id has been closed
        }
    })
