== Using Scopes

Koin brings a simple API to let you define instances that are tied to a limit lifetime.

=== What is a scope?

Scope is a fixed duration of time or method calls in which an object exists.
Another way to look at this is to think of scope as the amount of time an objectâ€™s state persists.
When the scope context ends, any objects bound under that scope cannot be injected again (they are dropped from the container).

=== Scope definition

By default in Koin, we have 3 kind of scopes:

- `single` definition, create an object that persistent with the entire container lifetime (can't be dropped).
- `factory` definition, create a new object each time. Short live. No persistence in the container (can't be shared).
- `scoped` definition, create an object that persistent tied to the associated scope lifetime.

To declare a scoped definition, use the `scoped` function like follow:

[source,kotlin]
----
module {
    scoped { Presenter() }
}
----

A scope gathers scoped definitions for the same logical unit of time:

[source,kotlin]
----
module {
    scope("A Scope Name"){
        scoped { Presenter() }
        // ...
    }
}
----


=== Working with a scope

A scope instance can be created with as follow: `val scope = koin.createScope("myScope")`. The "myScope" string here, is the id of your scope instance. 

To resolve a dependency using the scope we can do it like:

* `val presenter = scope.get<Presenter>()` - directly using the get/inject functions from the scope instance
* `val presenter = get<Presenter>(scope = scope)` - by passing yoru scope instance to any get/inject function

[IMPORTANT]
====
A scope definition can't be resolved if associated scope has not been created. Then `get<Presenter>()` return an error.
====

=== Open/Closed scope

As you may have seen, you can declare with or without a scope group:

[source,kotlin]
----
module {
    // open scope scoped definition
    scoped { Presenter() }
}

//or

module {
    // define a scope "A_SCOPE_NAME"
    scope("A_SCOPE_NAME"){
        // scoped definition tied to "A_SCOPE_NAME" scope
        // also known as closed scoped definition 
        scoped { Presenter() }
    }
}
----

In the case where a scoped definition is not tied to a scope, you can resolve from an open scope instance:

[source,kotlin]
----
// create an open scope "myScope"
val scope = koin.createScope("myScope")
// resolve presenter instance
val presenter = scope.get<Presenter>()
----

in the case of scoped definition to a scope, we have to declare a closed scope:

[source,kotlin]
----
// create an closed scope instance "myScope" for scope "A_SCOPE_NAME"
val scope = koin.createScope("myScope","A_SCOPE_NAME")
// resolve presenter instance
val presenter = scope.get<Presenter>()
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot mix open or closed scoped instances. A closed scope instance is dedicated to resolve scoped dependencies from a defined scope group.
An open scope is not tied to a scope group, and can allow to resolve any scoped definition out of a scope group. 
====

=== Create & retrieve a scope

From a `KoinComponent` class or where you can access your Koin instance:

- `createScope(id : String)` - create an open scope instance with given id
- `createScope(id : String, scopeName : String)` - create a closed scope instance with given id and scopeName
- `getScope(id : String)` - retrieve a previously created scope with given id
- `getOrCreateScope(id : String)` - create or retrieve if already created, the open scope instance with given id
- `getOrCreateScope(id : String, scopeName : String)` - create or retrieve if already created, the closed scope instance with given id and scopeName

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make the difference between a scope instance id, which is the id to find your scope over all your scopes, and the scope name, which is the reference to the tied scope group name.
====

=== Creating scope instances

Using the id, it's then possible to have several instances of the same scope:

[source,kotlin]
----
// create an closed scope instance "myScope1" for scope "A_SCOPE_NAME"
val myScope1 = koin.createScope("myScope1","A_SCOPE_NAME")
// create an closed scope instance "myScope2" for scope "A_SCOPE_NAME"
val myScope2 = koin.createScope("myScope2","A_SCOPE_NAME")
----


=== Resolving dependencies within a scope

The intestest of a scope is to define a common logical unit of time for scoped definitions. It's allow also to resolve definitions from within the given scope

[source,kotlin]
----
// given the classes
class ComponentA
class ComponentB(val a : ComponentA)

// module with scope
module {
    
    scope("A_SCOPE_NAME"){
        scoped { ComponentA() }
        // will resolve from current scope instance
        scoped { ComponentB(get()) }
    }
}
----

The depedendecy resolution is then straight forward:

[source,kotlin]
----
// create an closed scope instance "myScope1" for scope "A_SCOPE_NAME"
val myScope1 = koin.createScope("myScope1","A_SCOPE_NAME")

// from the same scope
val componentA = myScope1.get<ComponentA>()
val componentB = myScope1.get<ComponentB>()
----

=== Closing a scope

Once your scope instance is finished, just closed it with the `close()` function:

[source,kotlin]
----
// from a KoinComponent
val session = getKoin().createScope("session")

// use it ...

// close it
session.close()
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Beware that you can't inject instances anymore from a closed scope.
====

=== Scope callback -- TODO
